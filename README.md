# Structural-bioinformatics project description

1. The project includes the following components:
- Implementation of the dynamic programming crude energy minimization algorithm for RNA folding, with the following graphical representations:
- Energy matrix representation
- Backtrack matrix representation for optimal path identification
2. Analysis of the difference between c-RMSD and d-RMSD as protein similarity measures for 10 conformations.
3. Calculation of the Caely manger matrix.
